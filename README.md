# Is this tool safe?

While it is always a good idea to review and vet all code and tools that you've downloaded from the web, we must ensure that the tools do not harm your system or network.

I am not the author of this tool, but I discovered it on the Internet years ago and found it useful as an OSINT tool. I have reviewed and vetted this OSINT script.

For additional safety with cybersecurity-related tools, I recommend running this on a KAli Linux machine in a lab environment isolated from your home or production network.
